> Desktop app for dividing GitHub issues and pull requests into go or no-go quickly.

![Triage for GitHub](./pages/triage-for-github2.gif)

Enable to classify a lot of issues and pull requests.


## Motivation

We can use an ecosystem with GitHub - CI, coverage and pull requests.

E.g.

* [Dependency Update as a Service - Tachikoma.io](http://tachikoma.io/)
* [greenkeeper](http://greenkeeper.io/)
* [deppbot - Automated Dependency Updates](https://www.deppbot.com/)

(Use [tachikoma.io](http://tachikoma.io/), please!)

But too many pull requests bother us. We often overlook this.

![Too many pull requests](./pages/too-many-pull-requests.gif)

Especially building an app by a pull request with an empty commit like ping, we want to close the pull
request quickly after confirming CI 'success'.


### Plan A: `/pulls`

See: https://github.com/pulls

![github pulls](./pages/github-pulls.gif)

We can see own pull requests at GitHub `/pulls`. This is similar to what we want.
And we can search a pull requests.
But we should click a pull request, open a pull request page, click the close button, close pull request page, click a pull
request, ...

It's too much.


### Plan B: Triage for GitHub

![Triage for GitHub](./pages/triage-for-github2.gif)

That is where "Triage for GitHub" comes in.

We can triage GitHub issues and pull requests.
We can "close" issues very quickly.
We can also "Jump" to details with GitHub UI.


## How to use


### Set up

Download from [Latest release](https://github.com/lyrictenor/electron-triage-for-github/releases/latest) for your own environment.

![settings](./pages/settings.gif)


#### About token

Set [GitHub personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) which scope is `repo` or `public_repo`.


#### Without token

Show `lyrictenor/example-issues`'s issues and pull requests.
You can create any issues, send a pull request.

This case, you have [too small GitHub's api limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting).

> 60 requests per hour.


### Show issues / pull requests

Order by updated at, desc. Only latest 5 days.


### Experimental: Autopilot

Set autopilot enable, then you get interval autopilot.

If your autopilot hangs up, move to debug pane and execute force unlock.


### Issue details

There are details about an issue and a pull request with "v" icon.
